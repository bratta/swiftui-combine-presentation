# SwiftUI and Combine

## Phase 2 Lunch and Learn

This repository contains both the code and the presentation used during the Phase 2 Lunch and Learn
on December 17, 2019.

## Installation

If you want to run this code yourself, you will need to have at least Xcode 11.1 installed. Clone
this repository, open the Xcode project file, and then be sure to change the *Bundle Identifier* on
the General tab of the project settings.

You will also need an [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) key. Create one and add it to
line 20 of the `UnsplashViewModel` for `client_id`.

Then you can build and run the project in the simulator of choice.
